# PRNG / Pseudo-Random Number Generators

* [histogram](github.com/jfsmig/prng/histogram) configure size slots and their respective weights, the generator will output numbers fitting in one of the intervals, uniformly distributed into the interval but picking that interval with a Weighted Random.
* [poisson](github.com/jfsmig/prng/poisson) produces discrete integers respecting the Poisson's law, given its lambda parameter.
